        <h1>Initial Ideas for Capstone Project</h2>
        <div class=half>
            <h2>Idea 1: The movement of Nigerian Cultural Artifacts</h2>
            <p>
                I envision this as an interactive mobile application targeting Nigerians interested in learning about the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial histories of our 
                country. I would focus on the spatial and temporal journeys of Nigerian cultural artifacts away from the societies in which their value, use, and creation were born. 
                For this project, I would define computation as technology carrying out repetitive tasks to share the cognitive load and free up space for humans to act more creatively 
                and critically. Given that most of the continent owning or having access to a mobile or smartphone, there is an unique opportunity to leverage 
                existing technology as a tool for education, organizing, and activism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Access to the internet and financial services (such as mobile money) is primarily through smartphones so this feels like a good meeting point. I am not sure what the final user 
                experience will be but I want to see if I can leverage cheaper, more readily available smartphones to affect the physical surroundings of the user as they follow the “artifacts” 
                around the world. (An aside, it would be interesting to create an application that allowed for user documentation of their learning experiences or of cultural artifacts that are 
                present in their daily lives to tie these “objects” back to reality.)
            </p>
        
            <h2>Idea 2: Material Dictionaries for Uganda or Nigeria</h2>
            <p>
                In the Building the Engine, Fatou Dieye introduced my colleagues and I to material dictionaries tailored to Rwanda. They describe the various architectural materials used throughout 
                the world but also quantify some financial and environmental costs of using each of the materials in Rwanda. These tools allow designers to choose materials for their projects based on 
                availability and desired level of affordability, sustainability, reproducibility, and modularity. I think Uganda and Nigeria could benefit from similar tools. My version of these tools would 
                include a user interface that allows the end user to peruse the data indiscriminately or quickly fill in a set of parameters to find a relatively good fit for the project. Much of the housing 
                in Nigeria and Uganda is self-built or designed by an engineer, construction manager, or builder. Hiring an architect is not as common. This tool could help on-the-ground design-build teams to 
                think about cost-effective forms of sustainable construction that are suitable for their specific climatic regions.

            </div>
            <h2>Idea 3: Fuel (commonly referred to as energy) in Informal Settlements in Kampala</h2>
            <p>
                This idea is less flushed out than the other two. I have access to data on a sample of households within a large informal settlement in Kampala, Uganda. This data is focused on their fuel consumption, 
                specifically as relates to cooking. Each data point is tied to a geographical point (generally accurate to about 10 meters). There is room to gather even more data since I oversaw the data collection 
                process over the summer and have strong connections to people who work and live in the community. This project could go a couple of different directions. I could collaborate further with Professor Vijay 
                Modi from the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science whose project I collected data for this past summer. I could create a tool for reimagining infrastructure development in this informal 
                settlement that might encourage more public investment in these areas. I could document and share the story of missing infrastructure in this area instead. As far as computation is concerned, this project 
                would be processing and (to some extent) interpreting data in a manner that a larger audience can digest quickly.
